                    <h2>The "T" is Not Silent: Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and Stonewall Inn</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Over fifty years from the events that transpired at Stonewall Inn, the legacy of trans activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera are still largely brushed aside by the mainstream movement for LGBT rights.</h3>
                    
                    <h5>by Daniel Trotta, Reuters<br>June 12, 2019</br></h5>
                    
                    
                    <p>According to LGBTQ legend it was Marsha P. Johnson, a black transgender woman, who threw the first brick at the Stonewall Inn 50 years ago, sparking the modern gay liberation movement.</p>

                    <p>Whether her act of rebellion was truly the first in the rioting is debatable, although she was “almost indubitably among the first to be violent,” writes David Carter in “Stonewall,” his 2004 book about the police raid on a New York gay bar that became a historic moment.</p>

                    <p>What is certain about Johnson’s role, at least for today’s transgender community, is that the stone she cast packed the most thunder.</p>

                    <p>Johnson, along with a fellow transgender woman Sylvia Rivera, who was of Puerto Rican and Venezuelan heritage, became inspirational leaders of the movement born in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, when lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and other queer people fought back against harassment.</p>

                    <p>The months after Stonewall were a time of LGBTQ unity that would not last long.</p>

                    <p>Gay men, mostly white, assumed leadership and ostracized trans women like Johnson and Rivera in the name of respectability, according to people involved in the movement at the time.</p>

                <p>As the 50th anniversary of Stonewall approaches, Johnson and Rivera are receiving a belated measure of recognition in death that coincides with a growing awareness of transgender rights.</p>

                <p>New York City announced last month it would build a memorial to Johnson and Rivera near the Stonewall Inn, the Greenwich Village bar whose name has become synonymous with LGBTQ rights.</p>

                <p>“It is certainly sad that their memories were not only forgotten but desecrated in many instances, and now they are at least back in the conversation,” said Andrea Jenkins, a black transgender woman on the Minneapolis city council. “I’m still not sure if they are getting the absolute credit they deserve.”</p>

                <p>The announcement was made as New York prepares to welcome 4 million visitors for World Pride 50 years after Stonewall. The annual parade — the legacy of a march organized by Johnson, Rivera and others on the uprising’s first anniversary — is set for June 30.</p>

                <p>Last week, the New York Police Department apologized for the first time for the raid.</p>
