                                    People often equate Pride Month to parades on city streets, merchandise wrapped in rainbow-patterned packaging, and weekend-long bacchanalia. When corporations have co-opted Pride, it's easy to forget how it began and how it continues to be for many people: a protest.

                                    Whether intentional or not, the outrage around the death of Elijah McClain has revolved around discussion of his goodness and charity, further reinforcing the idea that only the good deserve to be spared from police brutality.

                                <p>
                                    Nina Pop was a 28-year-old Black trans woman killed in Sikeston, MO. With the average life expectancy for Black trans women at only 35 years old, they face disproportionate amounts of violence in the United States, while often swept to the sides of mainstream movements for racial and gender equality.
