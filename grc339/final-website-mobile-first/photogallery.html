                    <h3>Over fifty years from the events that transpired at Stonewall Inn, the legacy of trans activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera are still largely brushed aside by the mainstream movement for LGBT rights.</h3>

Due to her background as a poor person of color and former sex worker, she not only advocated for LGBT+ rights, but also racial, economic, and criminal justice. </figcaption>

                            With mostly white gay men at the leadership, Rivera and Johnson were largely left out of talks with politicians for trans rights.

As the gay rights movement becomes more mainstream and trans folk continue to be left out of the conversation, it is important that we recognize its roots: a riot spearheaded by trans women of color. </figcaption> <!-- Photo by Julian Wan (@julianwan) on Unsplash. -->
